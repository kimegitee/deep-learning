# Udacity Deep Learning Foundations

My project submissions for Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Course which can be found at: <https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101>.

Each project final submission can be found in its own branch

## Project 1: Bike Usage Prediction

Build a regression model on the Bike Sharing Dataset: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset>.

## Project 2: CIFAR-10 Image Classification

Train a convolutional network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset: <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>.

## Project 3: Generate The Simpsons Scripts

Train a recurrent neural network to generate TV scripts from the Simpsons.

## Project 4: English - French Translation

Train a sequence-to-sequence model to translate English to French.

## Installation

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
